    <p><strong>What's Redux ? </strong></p>
    <p>Redux is an application state manager for JavaScript applications, and keeps with the core principles of the Flux-architecture by having a unidirectional data flow in your application.
      Redux applications have only one global, read-only application state.
      This state is calculated by "reducing" over a collection or stream of actions that update it in controlled ways.</p>
      <p><strong>Where to use it ?</strong><br>
        A small scenario will make its use quite clear <br><br>        
        <i> I am hoping you might have used facebook right :P so if you look @ facebook's website you will see multiple components like 
        navbar, left panel, chatbox etc. Ever wondered when a new message is delivered to you all these are updated simultaneously 
        how ? <br>
        If they went for srevices or Event Emitters they would be engulfed in a sea of spaghetti code.
        Which even if implemented will be very hard to debug or make changes .</i><br>
        <br>Here comes the use of ngrx state management all the information is stored @ a single place and all the components are notified when the state of the data is changed .</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><strong> and Ngrx ?</strong></p>
    <p>Redux state managers have been very well received and have inspired the creation of @ngrx,
      a set of modules that implement the same way of managing state as well as some of the middleware and tools in the Redux ecosystem.
      @ngrx was created to be used specifically with Angular and RxJS, as it leans heavily on the observable paradigm.
      <br>Both the Components you see above are managed using ngrx store (updated to v4).<br><br>
      Advantages of upgrading</p><br>
      <ul>
          <li><p>Official support for lazy loading</p></li>
          <li><p>implified testing</p></li>
          <li><p>Redesigned router integration</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Npm command to install ngrx <code>npm install @ngrx/core @ngrx/store --save</code></p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><strong>Reducer function for each data type you have in your application. The combination of these reducers will make up your application state:</strong></p>
      <pre class="counter">
        <code [innerHTML]="counterTs">
        </code>
      </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><strong>In your app's main module, import those reducers and use the StoreModule.provideStore(reducers) function to provide them to Angular's injector:</strong></p>
    <pre class="reducer">
        <code [innerHTML]="reducers"></code>
    </pre>
    <p><strong>You can then inject the Store service into your components and services. Use store.select to select slice(s) of state:</strong></p>
    <pre class="component">
        <code [innerHTML]="component"></code>
    </pre>

    <p>More on Ngrx Please follow these links <br>
    I have Developed a App which uses the whole ngrx suite [effects, store , platform , devtools etc ] . The whole state management
    of that app has been taken care by ngrx . Check out the git repo if you want it to be a starter guide for ngrx

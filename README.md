Working Example of the following code can be found under 
https://rahulrsingh09.github.io/AngularConcepts


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run ```ng build``` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Build using AOT ```ng build --prod --env=prod --output-hashing none```


## Running unit tests

Run ```ng test``` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run ```ng e2e``` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Things to Note

While Forking this Repo and trying to build the same,  you might encounter this error 
```Cannot find module './shared/firebase.config' in app.module and enviornment```

This is because i have some Production and Development Enviornment Settings that load my Firebase Details accordindly, you need to create your own firebase credentials.


So what you need to do is to create a file named as firebase.config.ts in Shared folder
and add your Firebase Credentials to the same , with a Structure like this in your firebase database
```
YOUR APP
|
|
| Comments
|   |
|    users
| pageCount
```

Like - 
```
export const firebaseConfigDev = {
    apiKey: "XXXXX",
    authDomain: "XXX",
    databaseURL: "XXX",
    projectId: "XXX",
    storageBucket: "XXXX",
    messagingSenderId: "XXXX"
};
```
and like wise for prod if any 
```
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "XXXXX",
    authDomain: "XXX",
    databaseURL: "XXX",
    projectId: "XXX",
    storageBucket: "XXXX",
    messagingSenderId: "XXXX"
};
```
This credentials will be given by Firebase when you create a new Webapp inside of ther console if any doubts please comment or get in touch .
